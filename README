The requirement of the Elevator Design Question contained a lot of inconsistencies, 
Therefore I have assumed a number of things to make the program work.

Assumptions are as follows :

1. In the input, user has to enter the currentfloor and destination floor of the passenger.
2. Only one elevator can be asssigned per passenger(person) (If we want multiple passengers per elevator, then we have to define a constant capacity)
3. Initially all elevators are at ground floor in this case 1
4. Priority is decided as follows to reduce how many times the elevator moves
    A. Closest to the elevator 
    B. Have small difference between current floor and destination floor
5. Elevator can move only one floor up/down in one count cycle
5. Cost is the total number of floors the elevators move
6. It takes one count cycle for a person to board the elevator


Structure of Classes and Responsibilities :

There are 4 classes:
1. Elevator : Handles the responsibility of Current_floor on which the elevator is, the person which is assigned to the elevator     
2. Person   : Handles the responsibility of a passenger including current floor of passenger, destination floor.
3. Driver   : This class simulates the whole application.
4. Main     : This is where main method resides. 


*to run the project from commandline, please use the jar and execute 
java -jar ElevatorProblem.jar *

or you can run Main.java which contains the main method.
